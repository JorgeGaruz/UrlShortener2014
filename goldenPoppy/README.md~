* [isAlive](https://github.com/adriangp/UrlShortener2014/tree/master/goldenPoppy/src/main/java/urlshortener2014/goldenPoppy/isAlive): Service that checks that an URL is alive. Service is at [http://localhost:8080/isAlive.html](http://localhost:8080/isAlive.html). An automatic test is at [http://localhost:8080/isAliveTest.html](http://localhost:8080/isAliveTest.html)

* [Interstitial](https://github.com/adriangp/UrlShortener2014/tree/master/goldenPoppy/src/main/java/urlshortener2014/goldenPoppy/intesicial): This service associates an `url` to a `sponsor`.
